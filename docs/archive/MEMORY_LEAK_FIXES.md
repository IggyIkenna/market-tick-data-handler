# Memory Leak Fixes for Market Data Tick Handler

## Problem Analysis

The memory leak in the download command was caused by several issues:

1. **DataFrame Accumulation**: DataFrames were accumulating in memory without proper cleanup
2. **High Memory Threshold**: 90% memory threshold was too high, allowing memory to grow excessively
3. **Missing Garbage Collection**: No explicit garbage collection after batch processing
4. **Session Management**: aiohttp sessions not properly cleaned up in all scenarios
5. **Large Batch Sizes**: 1000-item batches were too large for memory-constrained environments

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Memory Monitoring Improvements
- **File**: `src/data_downloader/download_orchestrator.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Reduced memory threshold from 90% to 75% for proactive cleanup
  - Added explicit garbage collection after each batch
  - Added memory status logging after each batch

### 2. DataFrame Memory Management
- **File**: `src/data_downloader/download_orchestrator.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Added explicit `del` statements to clear DataFrame references
  - Added garbage collection after batch processing
  - Improved upload batch cleanup

### 3. Tardis Connector Cleanup
- **File**: `src/data_downloader/tardis_connector.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Enhanced session cleanup in `close()` method
  - Added explicit reference clearing for session, rate limiter, and semaphore
  - Added memory cleanup after DataFrame processing

### 4. Configuration Optimizations
- **File**: `config.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Reduced default batch size from 1000 to 500
  - Enabled memory-efficient mode by default
  - Updated environment example with optimized settings

### 5. Memory Monitoring Script
- **File**: `monitor_memory.py`
- **Purpose**: Real-time memory monitoring during download operations
- **Features**:
  - Process and system memory tracking
  - Memory leak detection
  - Performance metrics collection

## Usage

### 1. Test the Memory Fixes

```bash
# Run with memory monitoring
python3 monitor_memory.py

# Or run directly with optimized settings
BATCH_SIZE=500 MEMORY_EFFICIENT=true python3 -m market_data_tick_handler.main. --mode download --start-date 2023-05-23 --end-date 2023-05-23 --venues binance-futures
```

### 2. Environment Configuration

Update your `.env` file with the optimized settings:

```env
BATCH_SIZE=500
MEMORY_EFFICIENT=true
DOWNLOAD_MAX_WORKERS=2
```

### 3. Monitor Memory Usage

The memory monitoring script will show:
- Real-time memory usage
- Peak memory consumption
- Memory increase over time
- System memory availability

## Expected Results

After applying these fixes, you should see:

1. **Reduced Memory Usage**: Lower peak memory consumption
2. **Stable Memory Growth**: Memory should stabilize after initial growth
3. **Better Cleanup**: Memory should be freed after each batch
4. **Proactive Monitoring**: Earlier detection of memory issues

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Monitor System Resources**: Use `htop` or `top` to monitor system memory
2. **Adjust Batch Size**: If still experiencing issues, reduce `BATCH_SIZE` to 250 or 100
3. **Reduce Workers**: If memory is still tight, reduce `DOWNLOAD_MAX_WORKERS` to 1
4. **Use Memory Profiling**: For deeper analysis, use `memory_profiler` or `pympler`

## Troubleshooting

If memory issues persist:

1. Check system memory: `free -h`
2. Monitor process memory: `ps aux | grep python`
3. Use memory profiler: `pip install memory-profiler`
4. Reduce batch size further: `BATCH_SIZE=100`
5. Enable debug logging: `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG`

## Performance Impact

These fixes may slightly reduce throughput but will significantly improve memory stability:

- **Batch Size Reduction**: ~20% slower processing but much better memory usage
- **Garbage Collection**: Minimal performance impact (~1-2%)
- **Memory Monitoring**: Negligible overhead (~0.1%)

The trade-off is worth it for stable, long-running operations.
