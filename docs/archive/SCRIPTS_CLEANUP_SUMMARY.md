# Scripts Cleanup Summary

## What Was Removed

The following redundant scripts have been removed from `deploylocal/`:

1. ❌ `build-all.sh` - No longer needed (Docker Compose handles building)
2. ❌ `run-instrument-generation.sh` - Replaced by `run-main.sh`
3. ❌ `run-tardis-download.sh` - Replaced by `run-main.sh`

## What Remains

Only one script remains in `deploylocal/`:

✅ `run-main.sh` - Single convenience script for all operations

## Why This Simplification Works

### Before (Multiple Scripts)
```
deploylocal/
├── build-all.sh                    # ❌ Redundant
├── run-instrument-generation.sh    # ❌ Redundant  
├── run-tardis-download.sh          # ❌ Redundant
└── run-main.py                     # ❌ Wrong extension
```

### After (Single Script)
```
deploylocal/
└── run-main.sh                     # ✅ Single script for everything
```

## Benefits of the Cleanup

1. **Simplified Maintenance**: Only one script to maintain
2. **Consistent Interface**: Same command structure for all operations
3. **Less Confusion**: No need to remember which script does what
4. **Easier Documentation**: Single point of reference
5. **Cleaner Repository**: Fewer files to manage

## Usage After Cleanup

```bash
# All operations now use the same script
./deploylocal/run-main.sh instruments --start-date 2023-05-23 --end-date 2023-05-25
./deploylocal/run-main.sh download --start-date 2023-05-23 --end-date 2023-05-25
./deploylocal/run-main.sh full-pipeline --start-date 2023-05-23 --end-date 2023-05-25

# Or use the Python module directly
python -m src.main --mode instruments --start-date 2023-05-23 --end-date 2023-05-25
python -m src.main --mode download --start-date 2023-05-23 --end-date 2023-05-25
python -m src.main --mode full-pipeline --start-date 2023-05-23 --end-date 2023-05-25
```

## Docker Usage (Unchanged)

Docker usage remains the same since it uses Docker Compose:

```bash
# Instrument generation
cd docker/instrument-generation && docker-compose up --build

# Tick data download  
cd docker/tardis-download && docker-compose up --build
```

## Migration Complete

The migration from multiple scattered scripts to a single centralized entry point is now complete. The new architecture provides:

- ✅ **Single entry point** (`src/main.py`)
- ✅ **Single convenience script** (`deploylocal/run-main.sh`)
- ✅ **Environment-based configuration** (`.env` files)
- ✅ **Docker-friendly deployment** (updated Dockerfiles)
- ✅ **Comprehensive documentation** (usage guides and examples)

This makes the codebase much more maintainable and easier to deploy in containerized environments.
